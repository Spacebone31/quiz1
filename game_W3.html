                        defends. The main game mode, Search and Destroy, is very similar to CS:GO. The attacking team’s goal is to 
                        plant a bomb (called a spike) and have it detonate, while the defending team tries to avoid that. 
                        Regardless of whether the spike is planted or not, if a squad is wiped out before any other victory 
                        condition is met, the opposing squad will win.</p>

                        it's more hands-off, with you just watching your units do their specific things.</p>

                        the kingdom. However, as they grow up, Yuno demonstrates remarkable magical talent, while Asta has no magic abilities and 
                        relies on intense physical training. At age 15, Yuno receives a rare four-leaf clover Grimoire, while Asta gets nothing. Yuno 
                        is attacked by an enemy seeking his Grimoire, and Asta, despite his lack of magic, stands up to defend his friend. In a moment 
                        of desperation, Asta's strong emotions trigger a five-leaf clover Grimoire, granting him the power to defeat the attacker. 
                        Now, with their shared goal, they set out to achieve their dreams of becoming the Wizard King.</p>
